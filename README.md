# Algorithm Practice

Welcome to my `algorithm-practice` repository! This repository contains solutions to various algorithm and data structure problems solved using **Kotlin**, **Java**, and **Python**. It serves as a personal collection of coding challenges from different platforms such as **Programmers**, **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and more.

## Languages Used

- **Kotlin**: Used for modern, expressive, and concise solutions.
- **Java**: A robust language for solving complex algorithms with strong type-checking.
- **Python**: Great for rapid prototyping and readable solutions.

## Structure

The repository is structured by language and then further divided by problem categories (e.g., Arrays, Sorting, Dynamic Programming, etc.). Each folder contains solutions for different algorithm challenges.
